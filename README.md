 Hi there! My name's Elijah. I've been working as a registered nurse for over 2 years, while sharpening my skills with AWS, Java, and cybersecurity. I am currently studying Java programming, Linux-based command line operations, and cloud architect associate solutions. My end goal is to use my skill sets to improve health technology.
