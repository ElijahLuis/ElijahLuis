Hi there! My name's Elijah, but I go by Eli. I've been working as a registered nurse for over 2 years, but I'm leaning more into programming and cloud architecture nowadays. My skillsets are in nursing science, cloud architecture solutions, and front-end web development. My dream goal is to one day develop applications that can revolutionize health as we know it.
