Hi there! My name's Elijah, but I go by Eli. I've been working as a registered nurse for over 5 years, but I tend to dabble in programming and cloud architecture as well. My skillsets are in nursing science, cloud architecture solutions, and front-end web development. My dream goal is to one day develop applications that can revolutionize health as we know it.
